# Real-Time MPG Tracker and Eco-Driving Leaderboard

## Project Overview

This project tracks real-time fuel consumption (MPG) during vehicle commutes and provides comparisons against others who have driven the same route. Through leaderboards, it aims to promote eco-driving habits, reducing fuel consumption and environmental impact.
