# summary

## Work prior to moonshot presentation
I atempeted a number of prototype, some using a round earth model and some using real earth satelite and topographical data. This is the only part that was kept

## Work from presentation to summer holyday
- I had to scrap quite a large part of my previous ideas. 
- Attempted to merge the round earth model and the topgraphical data
- Early work on making flight phisics :
  -  Trying to apply NASA aerodinamic equation in unity eg. [Drag](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/drag-equation/)
  -  Trying to apply comon phisics equation like Gravity
  -  Troubled by unknown/uncalculable variable

## Work durring Summer holydays
- Problem with amount of data storage and procecing put real earth part of the prodject on hold
- Calculation of [International Standard Atmosphere](https://github.com/maxbernard3/International_Standard_Atmosphere)
- Attempt at simulating airflow to get Drag/Lift coeficient of 3D shape
- Learning blender to make 3D shapes of aircraft

## Work from Summer to December
- Attempt to stream data ala Microsoft flight simulator for real earth
  - Doesn't work after many atempt
  - Problem with datasource being inclompleet  
- Give up on Drag/Lift coeficient calculations *in house*, attempt with external tools
  - CFD Simulations are extremly taxing on computer resources
  - CFD Simulations are not a good representation of the forces I want to calculate
- Problem with precision floating point due to the earth sized object at the center of the simulation, atempempt to downsize earth model break flight model

## Work in January up to now
- Downscoped the project after realisation that I was 4 mounths past schedule
- Made a simple flate plain world, real earth project is abandoned
- Splified and reworked flight model to work with aproximative drag/lift coeficient
- Made flight model work on ecludian geometry, abandoned spherical geometry earth
